Not just today, not just this past week, or the month, or the semester. It’s felt like years since I was truly proud of what I was doing and who I was. However, it’s hard to compare those times to now because I wasn’t really conscious of a lot of things at the time. I don’t want to delve into everything right now because that would simply take too long and I am already procrastinating enough on my homework by writing this entry. I do feel as though it is worth it to outline some things for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is that I need to start going to bed at more reasonable hours. I’m not saying that I should be getting up super early, only that I start going to bed earlier. I feel as though waking up early will come with time. I’ve just gotten in the habit lately of staying up progressively later and later. Most nights I don’t fall asleep until 3:00 a.m. and on weekends I typically wake up in the afternoon. I always have a terrible feeling that sinks to the pit of my stomach when I finally roll out of bed on Saturday afternoon and realize that more than half the day is already gone. This needs to change. But, before I can do that there are other things I need to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With finals week approaching I don’t have time to implement these ideas but I feel like at least addressing them and being aware of the problems will help me in the future. First is that I need to start going to class more, even for the classes that I feel are a waste of time. I try to justify that instead of going to class I will do something more productive but that simply hasn’t been the case. Instead of going to class I frequently catch myself burning an hour on reddit (that entire website is an entire problem of itself, but will save it for another day) and ultimately I gain little to nothing from skipping lectures. I need to do a better job of that. I also need to start homeworks earlier and actually review material prior to lectures/exams well in advance. These are good habits that I need to start taking advantage of. The one takeaway that I have from this semester and even last semester to a certain extent is that bad habits build on top of each other just as well that good habits do. It is going to be tough but it needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s currently 2:14 a.m. and I’m tired but I still need to prepare for my EDPS socratic seminar tomorrow and finish (well actually start) my CMSC 250 homework, the last one (thank god).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first entry of hopefully many to come for this personal journal thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re almost at the end of this semester Ryan, let’s finish this thing strong.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Recently I feel like I have been letting myself down.
